# Project 3 - *SimpleTweet*

**SimpleTweet** is an android Twitter clone that allows users to sign in to their actual twitter account, see a feed from
 the accounts they follow, and actually compose and post a tweet.

## Notes

One of the biggest challenges I faced was trying to implement the Tweets Details Activity. While I was
 able to get the activity to load the textViews, I could not figure out how to get the imageViews to upload properly. 
 I plan to still continue to work on this project to develop a Twitter clone that is as functional as possible.
